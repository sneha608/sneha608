<p>About me: Sneha Sharma</p> 

<p>
    Ever since I gazed up at the stars as a child, I’ve been captivated by the mysteries of the universe and the intricacies of the human body. My ambition to pursue a career in either astronomy or dermatology is driven by a profound curiosity and a desire to make a difference in people’s lives. To achieve my goals, I am committed to maintaining straight A’s throughout high school while actively participating in clubs that fuel my passions, such as Science Olympiad and the Science National Honor Society. I plan to seek out internships that provide hands-on experience in both fields, along with taking relevant high school courses and enrolling in free college courses to deepen my knowledge. With several advanced classes like AP Calculus AB, AP World History, AP Psychology, and Honors Chemistry already on my schedule, I am laying a solid foundation for my future studies. Ultimately, my choice to explore dermatology and astronomy stems from a genuine interest in understanding the complexities of skin health and the wonders of space, and I am excited to embark on this journey.
